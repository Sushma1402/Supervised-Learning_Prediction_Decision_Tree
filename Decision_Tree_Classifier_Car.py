# ### Confusion matrix
# A confusion matrix is a tool for summarizing the performance of a classification algorithm. A confusion matrix will give us a clear picture of classification model performance and the types of errors produced by the model. It gives us a summary of correct and incorrect predictions broken down by each category. The summary is represented in a tabular form.
# 
# Four types of outcomes are possible while evaluating a classification model performance. These four outcomes are described below:-
# 
# True Positives (TP) â€“ True Positives occur when we predict an observation belongs to a certain class and the observation actually belongs to that class.
# 
# True Negatives (TN) â€“ True Negatives occur when we predict an observation does not belong to a certain class and the observation actually does not belong to that class.
# 
# False Positives (FP) â€“ False Positives occur when we predict an observation belongs to a certain class but the observation actually does not belong to that class. This type of error is called Type I error.
# 
# False Negatives (FN) â€“ False Negatives occur when we predict an observation does not belong to a certain class but the observation actually belongs to that class. This is a very serious error and it is called Type II error.
# 
# These four outcomes are summarized in a confusion matrix given below.

# In[53]:


# Print the Confusion Matrix and slice it into four pieces

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

entropy_c = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_en)

print('Confusion matrix\n\n', entropy_c)


# In[54]:


# Print the Confusion Matrix and slice it into four pieces

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

gini_c = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_gini)

print('Confusion matrix\n\n', gini_c)


# #### Classification Report
# Classification report is another way to evaluate the classification model performance. It displays the precision, recall, f1 and support scores for the model. I have described these terms in later.
# 
# We can print a classification report as follows:-

# In[55]:


from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_en))


# In[56]:


from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_gini))


# ### Results and conclusion
# 1. In this project, I have build a Decision-Tree Classifier model to predict the safety of the car. I build two models, one with criterion gini index and another one with criterion entropy. The model yields a very good performance as indicated by the model accuracy in both the cases which was found to be 0.8021.
# 2. In the model with criterion gini index, the training-set accuracy score is 0.7865 while the test-set accuracy to be 0.8021. These two values are quite comparable. So, there is no sign of overfitting.
# 3. Similarly, in the model with criterion entropy, the training-set accuracy score is 0.7865 while the test-set accuracy to be 0.8021.We get the same values as in the case with criterion gini. So, there is no sign of overfitting.
# 4. In both the cases, the training-set and test-set accuracy score is the same. It may happen because of small dataset.
# 5. The confusion matrix and classification report yields very good model performance.
